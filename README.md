## 📍 Overview
Project 5 details:
The project involves both traditional machine learning (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Passive Aggressive Classifier) and deep learning (LSTM) approaches for fake news classification.
The code demonstrates the preprocessing steps, TF-IDF vectorization, Word2Vec model training, and the training of different classifiers.
It's important to note that the success of the models depends on the characteristics of the dataset and the nature of the fake news problem being addressed.
The confusion matrices and accuracy scores provide insights into the performance of the models, and the training visualization helps understand the convergence of the deep learning model.

Project 6 details:
The project leverages the power of DistilBERT for fake news classification.
Visualizations and error analysis provide insights into the model's performance and potential areas for improvement.
The saved model can be easily shared and used for making predictions on new data.
The code demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline, from data exploration to model training, evaluation, and deployment
